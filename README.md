# pc3showandtell Docker Container

I have not really figured out what I wanted to do ... preferably something Fintech related from the Docker Hub marketplace.

Run with:

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 u1ih/hello
basically means to run the Docker Hub image Uli created for Hello World on port 8080. It will be replaced with whatever I want to do that I can find on docker hub.

This project assumes that you already have provisioned a GCP Shell.

Steps:
# 1. Get Source

git clone https://github.com/u1i/docker-hello
